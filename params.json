Open the `./ouput/sample.html` file in your browser, and\r\nthen just save your markdown document when you want to see a fresh preview.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nMarkdown is limited to basic html markup. Follow the `resume/sample.md` file \r\nas a guideline. This file includes various headers and several nested elements.\r\nThis allows us to construct a semantic HTML document for the resume, and then\r\nuse a CSS rules to display a very nice resume. Note that because we have very\r\nfew ways to nest or identify elements that many of the css rules are based\r\non descendant and adjacent selectors. \r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe initial inspiration is from the [Sample Resume Template](http://sampleresumetemplate.net/).\r\nHowever, no HTML from that project has been used in this. General layout has been reused, and media queries\r\nhave been added. It's a nice template, and if you are a more comfortable with html than markdown, you should use it.","tagline":"An elegant set of css rules for generating a resume with Markdown","note":"Don't delete this file!
