You can view a sample\r\nat the [blog post for the project][blog].\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Three styles to choose from: modern, blockish, unstyled (Fork and add more!)\r\n* PDF generation via [wkhtmltopdf][wkhtmltopdf]\r\n* Responsive design for multiple device viewport sizes\r\n* Simple Markdown formatting\r\n* Single file deployment (no external stylesheets)\r\n* You can now version control and branch your resume.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\n  There is no installation or need to run composer. Just run the phar file:\r\n\r\n    ./bin/md2resume html examples/source/sample.md examples/output/\r\n    ./bin/md2resume pdf examples/source/sample.md examples/output/\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\n    Markdown Resume Generator version 2.0.0 by Craig Davis\r\n    \r\n    Usage:\r\n      [options] command [arguments]\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      --help           -h Display this help message.\r\n      --quiet          -q Do not output any message.\r\n      --verbose        -v|vv|vvv Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\r\n      --version        -V Display this application version.\r\n      --ansi              Force ANSI output.\r\n      --no-ansi           Disable ANSI output.\r\n      --no-interaction -n Do not ask any interactive question.\r\n    \r\n    Available commands:\r\n      help         Displays help for a command\r\n      html         Generate an HTML resume from a markdown file\r\n      list         Lists commands\r\n      pdf          Generate a PDF from a markdown file\r\n      selfupdate   Updates md2resume.phar to the latest version.\r\n      templates    List available templates\r\n      version      Show current version information\r\n    \r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nChoose a template with the -t option.\r\n\r\n    ./bin/md2resume html --template blockish examples/source/sample.md examples/output/\r\n\r\nIf you want to edit your markdown resume in your editor while watching it\r\nupdate in your browser, run this command:\r\n\r\n    watch ./bin/md2resume html --refresh examples/source/sample.md examples/output/\r\n    \r\nThis makes the build script run periodically, and html document will refresh\r\nevery two seconds via a meta tag. Open the `./examples/ouput/sample.html` file\r\nin your browser, and then just save your markdown document when you want to see\r\na fresh preview.\r\n\r\n## Authoring Your Resume\r\n\r\nMarkdown is limited to basic html markup. Follow the `examples/source/sample.md`\r\nfile  as a guideline. This file includes various headers and several nested\r\nelements. This allows us to construct a semantic HTML document for the resume,\r\nand then use CSS rules to display a nicely formatted resume. Note that because\r\nwe have very few ways to nest or identify elements that many of the css rules\r\nare based on descendant and adjacent selectors. \r\n\r\n__PLEASE NOTE__: The templates are compiled into the phar archive in the `./bin`\r\nfolder. If you intend to edit the templates or add new ones, you'll need to run\r\nthis application in the dev mode. See below for more information about doing\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n## Feature Development\r\n\r\nThe application is deployed as a compiled phar file. In order to add new\r\ncommands, you'll need to first install the dependencies:\r\n\r\n* `composer install`\r\n* `pear install PHP_CodeSniffer`\r\n* [install pake][pake]\r\n\r\nAfter that, you can run the `md2resume_dev.php` file from the command line.\r\nCheck out the pake tooling for more information about the build.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe initial inspiration is from the [Sample Resume Template][srt].\r\nHowever, no HTML from that project has been used in this. General layout has\r\nbeen reused, and media queries have been added. It's a nice template, and if you\r\nare a more comfortable with html than markdown, you should use it.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* __2.0.0__ : Complete rewrite with the [symfony console component][console].\r\n  Deployment is now done with a compiled phar file, and development dependencies\r\n  are managed with composer.\r\n* __0.9.0__ : Add composer and update README with new changelog\r\n* __0.8.8__ : Add Chinese text example (@ishitcno1)\r\n* __0.8.7__ : Update pdf formatting of the modern template (@roleary)\r\n* __0.8.6__ : Fix output path (@abhikandoi2000)\r\n* __0.8.5__ : Fix issue #2\r\n* __0.8.4__ : Correct chmod and add parameter for output directory (@kevinxucs)\r\n* __0.8.2__ : Update build script and add refresh command option\r\n* __0.8.1__ : Updating formatting of initial templates\r\n* __0.8__ : Initial Release to Public \r\n\r\n[srt]: http://sampleresumetemplate.net/ \"A great starting point\"\r\n[blog]: http://there4development.com/blog/2012/12/31/markdown-resume-builder/\r\n[pake]: https://github.com/indeyets/pake/wiki/Installing-Pake\r\n[wkhtmltopdf]: https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF\r\n[console]: http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html\r\n","google":"UA-8504376-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
